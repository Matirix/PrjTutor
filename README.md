# PRJ TUTOR

## Description
Project Tutor is a web application designed to assist tutors in managing their students and assignments efficiently. 
The application allows tutors to enroll students, assign various types of assessments (in-class exercises, homework, tests), 
and provide feedback on student performance. It supports tracking students' progress through grades, strengths, weaknesses, and learning objectives for each week.

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core**: Framework for building the web application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Object-relational mapper (ORM) for database operations.
- **SQL Server**: Database management system to store student and assignment data.
- **HTML/CSS**: For front-end design and structure.
- **JavaScript**: To enhance interactivity and user experience.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and layout.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Development environment for coding and testing.

## Current Progress
- Models have been created for `Student` and `Assignment`, including properties for grading and assessment tracking.
- Controller actions implemented for CRUD operations on assignments and students.
- Views developed using Razor syntax to create user interfaces for managing students and assignments.
- Feedback forms are designed to capture student performance weekly.
- Migration system set up to manage database schema changes effectively.
